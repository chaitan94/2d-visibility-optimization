# 2D Visibility Optimization

Aim is to maximize the amount of area visibile to a source given it's initial position and the details of oter objects present.

This is being done as a course project for the course CS 357 - Optimization Algorithms & Techniques under [Dr. Kapil Ahuja](http://iiti.ac.in/people/~kahuja/)

Project presentation is available at [https://chaitan94.github.io/2d-visibility-optimization/presentation](https://chaitan94.github.io/2d-visibility-optimization/presentation)
